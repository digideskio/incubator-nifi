<ul>
    <li>Hadoop Configuration Resources
        <ul>
            <li>A file or comma separated list of files which contains the Hadoop file system configuration.
                Without this, Hadoop will search the classpath for a 'core-site.xml' and 'hdfs-site.xml' file or will
                revert to a default configuration.</li>
            <li>Default value: none</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Target dataset URI</b>
        <ul>
            <li>URI of the dataset where records are stored. View URIs are also allowed.</li>
            <li>This property supports the NiFi expression language.</li>
            <li>Default value: none</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>CSV charset

    </li>
    <li>CSV delimiter
